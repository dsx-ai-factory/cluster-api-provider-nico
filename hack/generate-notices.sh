# Third-Party Notices

This project links the Go modules listed below. Their licenses are reproduced in
full so that binaries and container images built from this repository ship with
the attribution those licenses require.

## Scope

Generated from the import closure of \`${PACKAGES[*]}\` in module
\`${LOCAL_MODULE}\`, for $(printf '%s ' "${PLATFORMS[@]}" | sed 's/ $//').

The Go standard library is excluded, as are packages belonging to this module.
Test-only and build-time dependencies that are not reachable from the released
commands are not listed, because they are not distributed.

## Dependency Index

| Package | License | Module |
